# Title: Homework 1

## Description:
This homework was a refactoring of a webpage changing divs to semantic html while maintaining css changes.

I built this project to learn more about webpages, html, css and to improve my skills with both.

I learned a good bit about css parent/child relationships and the evils of div. I was also not aware that semantic html had any effect on SEO, apparently it does!

The code is a good bit cleaner/more readable now while maintaining the same functionality.
